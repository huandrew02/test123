# Tip Calculator App

A Android application that takes users' inputs for the amount on their check and the number of people splitting the check. The app then calculates how much the tip and total would be for each person, calculating for only 15%, 20%, and 25% tips. The results will be rounded to the nearest integer to avoid any minor rounding conflicts.

## How to Use
1. Enter an amount (non-negative)
2. Enter the number of people that are splitting the bill
3. Click the "Compute tip" button to calculate the tip and total values for 15%, 20%, and 25% tips
4. If the input is empty or invalid, a Toast message will appear

## Note
Tip Calculator App works on devices with minimum API level 25.
